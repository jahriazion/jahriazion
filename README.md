Iâ€™m a developer who blends game design and full-stack engineering to create immersive, high-performance experiencesâ€”both in virtual worlds and real-world applications.

Currently studying Computer Science at Cal Poly Humboldt, I work across:
	â€¢	Frontend engineering â€“ Crafting clean, responsive UIs with modern frameworks and design systems.
	â€¢	Backend architecture â€“ Building secure, scalable APIs, databases, and cloud infrastructure.
	â€¢	Game development â€“ Developing multiplayer shooters & open-world environments in Unreal Engine 5 with replication, networking, and dynamic systems.

Beyond gameplay, I focus on integrated workflows that connect client-side experience with server-side performanceâ€”bridging the gap between design and engineering. My projects combine code quality, user experience, and scalability to deliver professional-grade results.

ðŸ”­ Currently Working On
	â€¢	Multiplayer PvP Shooter Prototype
Engineering core multiplayer systems in Unreal Engine 5, including replication, backend server integration, and responsive UI. Designing scalable environments that connect seamlessly with backend services for player data and matchmaking.
	â€¢	Open World PvP Shooter
Developing large-scale, dynamic environments with real-time lighting, vehicle integration, and networked interactions. Coordinating backend and frontend workflows to ensure smooth, scalable performance across devices.
	â€¢	Full-Stack Development & Engineering Workflow
Building end-to-end solutions: frontend (UI/UX with modern frameworks), backend (REST APIs, database design, cloud deployment), and integration with real-time game servers. Applying engineering principles to bridge gameplay systems with robust infrastructure.
	â€¢	Learning & Leveling Up
Expanding skills in C++, Python, and JavaScript frameworks alongside Unreal Engine 5â€™s Blueprint system. Strengthening experience in scalable architectures, multiplayer networking, and full-stack engineering for games and applications.
