Iâ€™m a developer who blends game design and full-stack engineering to create immersive, high-performance experiencesâ€”both in virtual worlds and real-world applications.

Currently studying Computer Science at Cal Poly Humboldt, I work across the stack:
	â€¢	Frontend Engineering â€“ Crafting clean, responsive UIs with modern frameworks and design systems.
	â€¢	Backend Architecture â€“ Building secure, scalable APIs, databases, and cloud infrastructure.
	â€¢	Game Development â€“ Developing multiplayer shooters and open-world environments in Unreal Engine 5 with replication, networking, and dynamic systems.

I focus on integrated workflows that connect client-side experience with server-side performance, bridging the gap between design and engineering. Every project balances code quality, user experience, and scalability to deliver professional-grade results.

ðŸ”­ Currently Working On
	â€¢	Multiplayer PvP Shooter Prototype â€“ Engineering core multiplayer systems in UE5, including replication, backend server integration, and responsive UI. Designing scalable environments that connect seamlessly with backend services for player data and matchmaking.
	â€¢	Open World PvP Shooter â€“ Developing large-scale, dynamic environments with real-time lighting, vehicle integration, and networked interactions. Coordinating backend and frontend workflows for smooth, scalable performance across devices.
	â€¢	Full-Stack Development & Engineering Workflow â€“ Building end-to-end solutions: frontend (UI/UX with modern frameworks), backend (REST APIs, database design, cloud deployment), and real-time game server integration.
	â€¢	Learning & Leveling Up â€“ Expanding skills in C++, Python, and JavaScript frameworks alongside UE5 Blueprint. Deepening expertise in scalable architectures, multiplayer networking, and full-stack engineering for games and applications.

ðŸš€ Goals
	â€¢	Launch first fully playable multiplayer PvP prototype in UE5 with stable networking, backend integration, and scalable environments.
	â€¢	Master full-stack game engineering from UI/HUD design to backend systems for authentication, matchmaking, and persistent data storage.
	â€¢	Advance multiplayer networking and replication with custom server logic and latency optimization.
	â€¢	Build a professional portfolio that merges gameplay quality with robust engineering, covering mechanics, UI/UX, database integration, and API-driven features.
	â€¢	Collaborate with a studio or engineering team to contribute both creative game dev skills and solid software engineering to ambitious projects.
