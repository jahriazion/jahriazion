I’m a developer who blends game design and full-stack engineering to create immersive, high-performance experiences—both in virtual worlds and real-world applications.

Currently studying Computer Science at Cal Poly Humboldt, I work across:
	•	Frontend engineering – Crafting clean, responsive UIs with modern frameworks and design systems.
	•	Backend architecture – Building secure, scalable APIs, databases, and cloud infrastructure.
	•	Game development – Developing multiplayer shooters & open-world environments in Unreal Engine 5 with replication, networking, and dynamic systems.

Beyond gameplay, I focus on integrated workflows that connect client-side experience with server-side performance—bridging the gap between design and engineering. My projects combine code quality, user experience, and scalability to deliver professional-grade results.
