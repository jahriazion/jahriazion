# **Full-Stack Engineer & UE5 Game Developer**  
**Multiplayer Systems | Scalable Web & Game Architecture**

---

Iâ€™m a developer who blends game design and full-stack engineering to create immersive, high-performance experiencesâ€”both in virtual worlds and real-world applications.

Currently studying Computer Science at Cal Poly Humboldt, I work across the stack:  
- **Frontend Engineering** â€“ Crafting clean, responsive UIs with modern frameworks and design systems.  
- **Backend Architecture** â€“ Building secure, scalable APIs, databases, and cloud infrastructure.  
- **Game Development** â€“ Developing multiplayer shooters and open-world environments in Unreal Engine 5 with replication, networking, and dynamic systems.

I focus on integrated workflows that connect client-side experience with server-side performance, bridging the gap between design and engineering. Every project balances code quality, user experience, and scalability to deliver professional-grade results.
